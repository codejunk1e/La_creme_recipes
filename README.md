# La Cr√®me Recipies

This is a simple app that displays the recipes and details for making it.

What I did includes:
Productionizing an android app.
Taking an app from a functional state to a production-ready state.
Efficient handling of error cases.
Adding accessibility features and allowing for localization.
Working with android widget.

## Tech Used
* MVVM 
* LiveData
* ViewModel
* Room Database 

## Next Steps
Because this was initially my Udacity project, I was limited to using some specific tools. 
Some things I would like to do include:
* Refactor Codebase to Kotlin
* Ap Modularization
* Use Coroutines or RXJava for async operations
* Add Paging Library support
* Dependency Injection (Preferably Hilt)
